# DTSC-project
Our code was written in a python notebook within deepnote, we have given all the files used in conjuction with our data analysis notebook here. A link to our deepnote can be found here: https://deepnote.com/workspace/tanmay-is-doing-too-much-work-for-data-science-spring-2024-a8b9-72a1a820-a5af-4db8-b5aa-e1fed47e46f5/project/Census-Income-Data-Analysis-ff5a4b6e-1010-40e6-b198-76fe211c20a7/notebook/Data%20Analysis-67173dd3f6f943008284cc5c38b8b2fb

In order for the code to run in deepnote, it will need the "adult-dataset.csv" file , "requirements.txt" file, and the Data_Analysis.ipynb file. All the code has already been run through though and should be easy to read.
